# E-Commerce Web App Using React & React-router

The original website is hosted [here](https://in.sugarcosmetics.com/). A website to purchase cosmetics products.

## I reproduced this web app and tried to imitate their design and main features. 

On this project I focused on implementing a shopping cart.

### Once logged in, users can:
- Home Page
- Add products to their shopping cart
- Update the quantity, or Remove items
- See the total cost
- Payment method

The database includes 3 models: Home, User, Products and Cart,wishlist. When a user add a product to his cart, a new "cart item" will be added
to the Cart model with the product id. 

## How to run this application locally

To install all the packages, run:

```
npx create react-App application
```

Then run:

```
cd application
npm start 
```
